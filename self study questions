4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is a way to compile a new language into a previous one. Mostly for the purpose of adding new functionality to the original language.


5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept in less is parametric mixing because it allows you to right something akin to a css function. This allows for cleaner code. I also like using escapes for media queries.
